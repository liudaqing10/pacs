Try to compile by setting NOGLOBAL:

make clean
make CPPFLAGS+=-DNOGLOBAL

and see what happens.

Why?

Try to eliminate the static keyword in locals.cpp (or in locals2.cpp)

#include "globals.hpp"
#include "locals2.hpp"
#ifdef  NOGLOBAL
int globalValue;
#endif
//! If you wish you can use :: to specify the global scope
void zeroGlobal(){ ::globalValue=0;}

Try again (setting DNOGLOBAL) and see what happens! Why?
